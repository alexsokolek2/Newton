Currently configured to find the root of 4^X + 6^X - 9.
To configure for other functions, see the two defines.
Note that in addition to the main function, you need the derivative.

Only finds one root. This program was written to solve a FaceBook math
problem, namely solve for x where 4^x +6^x = 9.
